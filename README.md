HuffCompress is a file compression and decompression tool based on Huffman coding, a lossless data compression algorithm. It efficiently encodes characters using variable-length binary codes derived from their frequency in the input file. The project processes files by building a Huffman tree, generating codes for characters, and saving compressed output in a binary format. It also supports decompression to restore the original file from the encoded data. HuffCompress is designed to optimize storage and transmission of text-based files.
